## Some general notes for CSS.

#### Margin vs. Padding:
	Margin is the "extra" spacing outside of an element border.
	Padding is the spacing between an element's border and its content.

	(!) Use margin with caustion because it adds the extra white space to your page which may make it extra-wide or extra-heigh.
