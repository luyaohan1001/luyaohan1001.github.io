## Some general notes for CSS.

#### Margin vs. Padding:
	Margin is the "extra" spacing outside of an element border.
	Padding is the spacing between an element's border and its content.

	(!) Use margin with caustion because it adds the extra white space to your page which may make it extra-wide or extra-heigh.

#### class vs id
	class is used to assign styles in .css file, multiple elements can have same class to be assigned similiar design style.
	id is used to identify an element, usually it is unique to a single element.
