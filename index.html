            In 1999, I was born in East China, the city of Hangzhou. <br> <br>
            Witnessing the economics' rise, the country soon pivoted its development around first-tier cities. <br> <br>
            My family had decided to move to the city of Shanghai to seek better financial opportunities, and more importantly, education resources for their beloved children. <br> <br>
            My story began from here. <br> <br>

            I was the "mediocre kid" among the many. <br> <br>
            And you kind of had to be the best to get into a good college, then to be successful enough to live a good life. -- Typical Asian view of this kind of outlook yet by and large a true statement in developing countries like where I was from. <br> <br>
            December 16th, 2013, I got an admission letter from an international school that offered an equivalent high school curricula as those in the United States. <br> <br>
            After some thoughtful discussions, my family and I decided that I shall pursue the journey. <br> <br>
            That said, I was expected to earn a high school education enough to prepare for a U.S. college, deviating from what a normal student would experience at my age, and would take a path for higher education far away from home.  <br> <br>
            I was proud that I had qualified as one of the few students who had done really well in the qualification exam. <br> <br>

            High school was fun. <br> <br>
            As the school advocated -- "WHERE EAST MEETS WEST". <br> <br>
            Halloweens, Secret Santas, Pep Rally, Talent Show, Academic Debate, Musical Theaters... opened my eyes to the western world. <br> <br>
            I truly appreciated such an interesting cultural fusion. <br> <br>
            I also got to understand myself better. That, I was a true adherent of pragmatism. Now in hindsight, I realized that some signs manifested early that I thought and treat my problems like an engineer.<br> <br>
            Interestingly, I remembered once I programmed the auditorium stage lighting console for an entertaining Talent Show. I liked the sole magic power of machine intelligence. <br> <br>
            I tried programming microprocessors and on Linux-based computers, though. By then I thought the technology was "magical". <br> <br>

            The electrical engineering curriculum at UC Santa Barbara was composed of the lower-division and upper-dicision course sets. <br> <br>
            The lower-division courses were fundamental, introductory courses to prepare the student ready for advanced upper-division engineering courses with proper theory and mathematical foundations. <br> <br>
            During first-year I took Calculus, Differential Equations, Vector Calculus, Problem Solving with C++, and many others. <br> <br>
            During Sophomore year, I enjoyed and probably also hated the "10 Series", which was a whole year of continuous series for analog and digital circuits systems designs and analysis. <br> <br>
            Out of curiosity and with many C programming experiences in the past, I naturally enrolled in other more advanced C++ courses on Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and Software Architectures Courses. <br> <br>
            Countless times -- either it was a deeply hiding bug that existed in my program or an equation that turned out to be broken in the homework. I still recall the many nights in which I stumbled upon those hard problems I had faced. <br> <br>

            Having vaguely realized that my intrinsic curiosity lies in the digital hardware and lower-level software domain, I changed my major from Electrical Engineering to Computer Engineering. <br> <br>
            Well, the two majors had ~70% curriculum overlap except that I got to allocate more time to the software side of the spectrum, and less messy Semiconductor Physics. <br> <br>
            In my Junior and Senior year, my curriculum focused on Embedded Systems and Computer Architecture, which interestingly become the solid concentration of my master's study later. <br> <br>
            Some more courses taken included Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, Contex Optimization, Signal Analysis, and a tasteful selection of General Educations Courses.
            What I realized after taking these courses was that technicality and a college degree were merely the fundamentals of fundamentals. <br> <br>
            During the course training, the most important qualities I picked up was the ability to quickly ramp up onto an unsolved problem, produce an effective strategy incrementally, and gain confidence from tackling hard problems. <br> <br>
            When I started to realize I would no longer be afraid of certain problems, it meant I had gone through such cycles so many times and had already gained enough confidence in such areas. <br> <br>
