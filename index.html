                In 1999, I was born in Hangzhou, a city in East China. <br> <br>
                After witnessing the economic rise, the country soon pivoted its development around first-tier cities. <br> <br>
                My family had decided to move to the city of Shanghai to seek better financial opportunities and educational resources for their beloved children. <br> <br>

                December 16th, 2013, I got an admission letter from an international school that offered equivalent high school curricula as those in the United States. <br> <br>
                After some thoughtful discussions, my family and I decided that I shall pursue the journey. <br> <br>
                That said, I needed to earn a high school education enough to prepare for a U.S. college, deviating from what an average student would experience at my age, and would take a path for higher education far away from home.  <br> <br>
                I was proud that I had qualified as one of the few students who had done well in the qualification exam. <br> <br>

                High school was fun. <br> <br>
                As the school advocated -- "WHERE EAST MEETS WEST." <br> <br>
                Halloweens, Secret Santas, Pep Rally, Talent Show, Academic Debate, Theaters Arts -- numerous activities opened my eyes to the western world. <br> <br>
                I truly appreciated such an interesting cultural fusion. <br> <br>
                I also got to understand myself better. That, I was an adherent of pragmatism. In hindsight, I realized that the signs manifested as early as then, and I thought and treated my problems like an engineer.<br> <br>
                Interestingly, once I programmed the auditorium stage lighting console for an entertaining Talent Show. I liked the sole magic power of machine intelligence. <br> <br>
                I tried programming microprocessors and Linux-based computers, though. The technologies were magical to me. <br> <br>

                The electrical engineering curriculum at UC Santa Barbara was composed of the lower-division and upper-division course sets. <br> <br>
                The lower-division courses were introductory courses to prepare the student for advanced upper-division engineering courses with theoretical foundations. <br> <br>
                During my first year, I took Calculus, Differential Equations, Vector Calculus, Problem Solving with C++, and many others. <br> <br>
                During my Sophomore year, I enjoyed and probably also hated the "10 Series", a whole year of continuous series for analog and digital circuits systems designs and analysis. <br> <br>
                Out of curiosity and with many C programming experiences in the past, I naturally enrolled in other more advanced C++ courses on Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and Software Architectures Courses. <br> <br>
                I still recall the many nights I stumbled upon the problems I had faced.

                Having realized that my intrinsic curiosity lies in the digital hardware and lower-level software domain, I changed my major from Electrical Engineering to Computer Engineering. <br> <br>
                The two majors had ~70% curriculum overlap except that I got to allocate more time to the software side of the engineering spectrum. <br> <br>
                In my Junior and Senior years, my curriculum focused on Embedded Systems and Computer Architecture, which interestingly became the solid concentration of my master's study later. <br> <br>
                During the course training, the most important qualities I picked up were quickly ramping up onto an unsolved problem, producing an effective strategy incrementally, and gaining confidence from tackling. <br> <br>
                When I realized I would no longer be afraid of certain types of problems, it meant I had gone through such cycles so many times and had already gained enough confidence in such areas. <br> <br>
