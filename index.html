            1999, I was born in East China, the city of Hangzhou. <br> <br>
            Witnessing the economics' confident rise, the country soon pivoted its development around first-tier cities. <br> <br>
            My family had decided to move to the city of Shanghai to seek for better financial opportunities, and more importantly, the education resources for their beloved children. <br> <br>
            My story began from here. <br> <br>

            I was the "mediocre kid" among the many. <br> <br>
            And you kind of had to be the best to get into a good college, then to be successful enough to live a good life. -- Typical Asian view of this kind of outlook yet by and large a true statement in developing countries like where I was from. <br> <br>
            December 16th 2013, I got an admission letter from an international school that offered equivalent high school curriculum as those in the United States. <br> <br>
            After some thoughtful discussions, my family and I decided that I shall pursue the journey. <br> <br>
            That said, I was expected to earn a high school education enough to prepare for a U.S. college, deviating from what a normal student would experience at my age, and would take a path for higher education far away from home.  <br> <br>
            I was proud that I had been qualified as one of the few students who had done really well in the qualification exam. <br> <br>

            High school was fun. <br> <br>
            As the school advocated -- "WHERE EAST MEETS WEST". <br> <br>
            Halloweens, Secret Santas, Pep Rally, Talent Show, Academic Debate, Musical Theaters... opened my eyes to the western world. <br> <br>
            I truly appreciated such interesting cultural fusion. <br> <br>
            I also got to understand myself better. That, I was a true adherent of pragmatism. Now as a hindsight I realized that some signs manifested early that I thought and treat my problems like an engineer.<br> <br>
            Interestingly, I remembered once I programmed the auditorium stage lighting console for an entertaining Talent Show. I liked the sole magic power of machine intelligence. <br> <br>
            I tried programming micro-processors, Linux, though not sure how to proceed. I thought the technology were "magical". <br> <br>

            September 3rd, 2017, I landed in the Los Angeles Airport. <br> <br>

            The electrical engineering curriculum at UC Santa Barbara was composed of the lower-division and upper-dicision course sets. <br> <br>
            The lower-division courses were fundamental, introdutory courses to prepare the student ready for advanced upper-division engineering courses with proper theory and mathematical foundations. <br> <br>
            First year I took Calculus, Differential Equations, Vector Calculus, Problem Solving with C++, and many others. <br> <br>
            Somophore year, I enjoyed and probably also hated the "10 Series", which was a whole year of continuous series for analog and digital circuits systems designs and analysis. <br> <br>
            Out of curiosity and with many C programming experiences in the past, I naturally enrolled in other more advanced C++ courses on Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programmings and Software Architectures Courses. <br> <br>
            Countless times -- either it was a deeply hiding bug existed in my program or an equation turned out to be broken in the homework. I still recall the many nights in which I stumbled on those hard problems I had faced. <br> <br>

            Having vaguely realized that my intrinstic curiosity lying in the digital hardware and lower-level software domain, I changed my major from Electrical Engineering to Computer Engineering. <br> <br>
            Well, the two majors had ~70% curriculum overlap except that I got to allocate more time to software side of the spectrum, and less messy semiconductor Physics. <br> <br>
            In Junior and Senior year my curriculum had focused on Embedded Systems and Computer Architecture, which had interestingly became the solid concentration of my master study later. <br> <br>
            Some more courses taken included Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, Contex Optimizaton, Signal Analysis and a tasteful selection of General Educations Courses.
            What I had realized after taking these courses was that technality and a college degree were merely the fundamentals of fundamentals. <br> <br>
            During the course training the most important qualities I had picked up was the ability to quickly ramp up onto an unsolved problem, produce an effective strategy incrementally, and gain confidence from tackling hard problems. <br> <br>
            When I started to realize I would no longer be afraid of certain problems, it meant I had gone through such cycles so many times and had already gained enough confidence in such area. <br> <br>

            Where did I see myself in the forthcoming future? <br> <br>
            After trying multiple research assistance positions in labs I had clearly shown poor enthusiasm towards becoming a researcher. <br>  <br>
            Well, I did loved reading textbooks and papers though, given if they were closely related to the application field. The semiconductor industry had always been a divine place that I looked up to. <br> <br>
            I interned at multiple companies and tried various things in different roles. And sure I was motivated!<br> <br>

            Carnegie Mellon University was deemed one of the most respected institutions in the fields of computers-related studies, in the world. <br> <br>
            The graduate-level topics in embedded domain were fascinating, itself was an entire spectrum and I gain much more momentum towards what I wished to do, I was accelerated. <br> <br>
